## 👋 Hey there!

I'm a Engineering Physics student at UFRGS, passionate about the intersection between physics, computation, and innovation.  

 I enjoy working on **embedded systems, IoT, and automation** projects — exploring how hardware and software can create smart solutions.  

 I'm also deeply interested in **data science and quantum computing**, where physics and math meets computation to uncover new possibilities.  

 Always learning, experimenting, and building.
